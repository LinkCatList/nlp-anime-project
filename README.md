# DescriptionðŸŒ¸

At school we were given the task to write a neural network using `nlp` technologies. We have made a neural network that allows you to search for the anime genre by its description.
Neural network training took place through datasets with `kaggle` using `Keras` and `TensorFlow`. For convenient use of the neural network, it was decided to create a website and upload a neural network to it. Now the neural network can be used by following the [link](https://arbuz.stevedoh.com/), it has the ability to log in, view the `leaderboard` with other users. When you request a neural network, you will be given a page with one of `ten` anime genres, each of which will feature `three` anime of this genre and the opportunity to go and watch them on anime.go

# Start websiteðŸŒ¸
```
git clone https://github.com/LinkCatList/nlp-anime-project.git
cd nlp-anime-go 
go run main.go
cd nlp-anime-py/src
uvicorn main:app --port 3000
```
open localhost:8000
